### Knowing Everything About Discord

...

### Building And Moderating Discord Servers

...

### Developing Discord Bots

#### Requirements

- JavaScript/TypeScript programming basic knowledge
- Stable version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) downloaded
- An IDE like [Visual studio code](https://code.visualstudio.com) or [Web storm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm)
- Bot hosting server, you can use your machine with a startup command and [pm2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pm2)

#### Bot Code Template

Even though our tools make the process of creating bots easy, it's still annoying to build a bot from scratch every time, that's why we made the template [FullBot][fullbot] (the template name shows that it provides a full functioning bot code), you can download/fork the repository code and follow the setup up instructions to get your bot running in less than 10 minutes

[![FullBot](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/pin/?username=DisQada&repo=FullBot&theme=prussian)][fullbot]

#### Framework

Foundational structure that simplifies the process of creating bots by providing a set of pre-built functionalities and structures, it allows developers to focus on the unique features of their bots rather than the boring repetitive code

[![HalfBot](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/pin/?username=DisQada&repo=HalfBot&theme=prussian)][halfbot]

#### Tools/Libraries

Additional structures that encapsulate a tiny job in a package that can extend and empower the strength of [HalfBot][halfbot] framework

These tools were created with abstraction in-mind, they can be used without [HalfBot][halfbot] and in projects that are not Discord bots

[![Scraper](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/pin/?username=DisQada&repo=Scraper&theme=prussian)](https://github.com/DisQada/Scraper)

[![TypeDoc](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/pin/?username=DisQada&repo=TypeDoc&theme=prussian)](https://github.com/DisQada/TypeDoc)

### Integrating Other Platforms With Discord

We're experimenting with Google's API to improve the use of it's ecosystem starting with Google Forms

More information will be revealed later Insha Allah
